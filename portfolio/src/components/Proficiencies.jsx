          <Proficiency name="Python" years="3" src={python}>
            Python is the very first programming language I learned. I started learning it when I was 15. Over the years I've been consistently using it for automating terminal tasks and once every while I'd work on an app using the kivy framework.
          </Proficiency>

          <Proficiency name="Ruby" years="1" src={ruby}>
            I learned ruby 2nd it is by far the language I enjoyed the most to use. Back when I learned it I was way more concerned about using languages that were popular and it being not that popular crushed my love for the language. ðŸ’”
          </Proficiency>

          <Proficiency name="Java" years="2" src={java}>
            I started learning java in my final year of highschool. The same year, I was introduced to LibGDX (a game development kit). The game dev basics I learned from LibGDX came in handy with Godot. Since then, I've also experimented with other JVM derivatives such as Kotlin and Groovy (which was my favorite of the JVM languages).
          </Proficiency>

          <Proficiency name="Javascript" years="2" src={javaScript}>
            I started learning javascript later in highschool, I believe, when I was 17. At that time I was very fascinated by the Qt framework and I used Javascript along with their QML language to make gui applications. Later on I moved to using it to create webpages (how surprising ðŸ˜…) as well as to create mobile apps with React Native.
          </Proficiency>

          <Proficiency name="C#" years="1" src={cSharp}>
            This happens to be the latest languages I've learnt. I learnt it as part of my first year modules in university. I don't find it particularly interesting. I guess I like it's almost java like structure and syntax. ðŸ¤£
