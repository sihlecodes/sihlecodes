          Ever since I was young I always new I wanted to do something related to technology; I found it fascinating.
          During my grade 3 year I was tasked to create a recycling awareness poster for my school and later on that year
          I received the award for computer skills.

          Skipping forward a couple of years, when I was my grade 9 year I became curious about programming. I initially assumed that I needed to know binary and so I learnt how the binary number system works and how these numbers get converted into other characters using the ASCII character encoding scheme. I later on realized that learning binary was not getting me any closer to my goal of learning how to program. So, I went back to the drawing board and instead of assuming; this time I searched the internet asking the simple question "How do you program?". I went through a couple of web pages and eventually discovered the first programming language I learnt, python.

          Over the years I've spent a fair amount of time on languages such as ruby, java, groovy, javascript. I've also dabbled in C/C++, C# and shell scripting languages such as bash and zsh.
