      <h2>About</h2>

      <div className="About-content">
        <p>
          I am a Self-driven, hardworking, and dependable individual. I enjoy problem solving, programming, and
          learning new skills.
        </p>

        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <div>
          <p>Ever since I was young I always new I wanted to do something related to technology; I found tech fascinating.</p>
          {/* <ReadMore> */}
            <p>
              When I was in high school, at age 15, I became curious about programming but IT wasnâ€™t offered as a subject at my school so I set out to teach myself. Initially, I thought that programming was all about numbers and binary, but quickly realized that wasnâ€™t the case. So I went back to the drawing board and did some actual research on how programming is actually done. In the process, I discovered python: the language that introduced me to the programming world.</p>
            <p>
              Despite all the confusion and frustration in the beginning, I fell in love. I knew that this is something I want to do for the rest of my life. Till this day, I feel a strange and deep connection with programming: it fulfills me.
            </p>
            <p>
              <i>Deciding to learn programming is the best decision Iâ€™ve ever made.</i>
            </p>
          {/* </ReadMore> */}
        </div>

        <h3>My Vision</h3>

        <p>Ultimately, I believe <i>my purpose in life is making peopleâ€™s lives easier through technological means.</i> Unfortunately, Itâ€™s not exactly clear to me, just yet, how Iâ€™ll make that work.</p>

        <p>So for now, I want to focus on my studies in University. Along the way also I want to offer my assistance to at least a handful of people and help them realize their own love for programming.</p>

        <h3>Check out some of my work</h3>
        <p>A quick word of warning: I haven't used my instagram for a while. ðŸ˜…</p>
