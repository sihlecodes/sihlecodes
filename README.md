### Sihlecodes

Hi, I’m a Siphesihle! I make games, and personal productivity tools.

#### Fun facts
* Currently doing my degree in Computer Science and Maths.
* When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me tinkering with electronics.
* I'm also pretty good at drawing. (I haven't drawn in years though :sweat_smile:)
